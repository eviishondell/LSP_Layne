How is design pattern reuse different from code reuse?  Please do not write a dissertation, a few sentences should suffice.


Code reuse calls a lot of code that is visible to the client, while design pattern code is in the back and not visible to the client. 
The readability and organization of  design pattern reuse is much better than general code reuse. A design pattern involves more than one
class and interconnection among objects from different classes. Patterns AID the structure and collaboration of participants in a software 
architecture ata higher level than  object-oriented design models that focus on individual objects and classes.
